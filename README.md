# # D&D 5E Unity Toolkit

This project is intended to be used as a starting point for any turn based RPG game made with Unity.
The scope is to build a system inspired on *Baldur's Gate III* and based on the rule book of **Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition** [ENG](https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf) / [ES](https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1_ES.pdf).
